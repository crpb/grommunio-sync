grommunio Sync
==============

**grommunio Sync is an open-source application to synchronize Exchange ActiveSync
(EAS) compatible devices such as mobile phones and tablets.**

*While Microsoft Outlook supports EAS, it is not recommended to use grommunio
Sync due to a very small subset of features only supported. For Microsoft
Outlook, users should rather use the native MAPI/HTTP and MAPI/RPC protocols,
available through `grommunio Gromox <https://github.com/grommunio/gromox>`.*
